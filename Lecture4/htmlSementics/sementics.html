    SEMENTICS MEANS SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.
    This is just the theory part.
    hume html tags according to need use karne chahiye.
    e.g.  agar hume website me upar kuch likhna h toh use header tag.
    agar hume website me multiple same cheeje banani h (same apparence ) like products on flpkart etc. use article tag.
    agar jo cheej change hori ho toh use section tag.

    WEBCRAWLERS=these read our website and put the result in front of the user who is saerching.
    like we are searching for youtube, then webcrawlers read the website and return the youtube not other website 
    but kaise, webcrawlers ki madad se . if we use correctly html tags , follow sementics then our website should rank 
    first on any search.
    THIS IS CALLED SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION.(SEO)
